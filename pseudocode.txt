loop 0-5 for 5 days
	loop 0-8 for 8 hours a day
		if (preferenece[i][m] == 0)
			loop 0-? for courses
				if (lecturer teaches that course && still have hour left && haven't taught that course today)
					call function?

//recursion or iteration?
recursion: slower and less efficient, but easier to generate all the different permutations
iteration: faster and much more efficient, but much harder to generate all the different permutations



using map or vector of maps instead? map a lecturer with all the hours they can teach that a week
or tuple?
map<string, int> teachingHours;			//string = lecturer name + hour, int = course to take


eliminate room: probably the easiest part
loop 0-40 for 40 hours/week
	if > 2 classes runnning at a time -> invalid:
		return;
	else:
		move on to checking preference
